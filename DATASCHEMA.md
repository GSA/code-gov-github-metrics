# Data Schema

## .csv report

Running the main script of this repo (instructions in [README.md](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-github-metrics/blob/master/README.md)) will create a .csv file report in the reports folder with the name `<CURRENT DATE> | <START OF TIME PERIOD TO QUERY> -> <END OF TIME PERIOD TO QUERY>.csv`. For instance, if you ran the script on July 9, 2019 to query data about the month of June 2019 (6/1/2019 - 7/1/2019), the report file name would be `2019-7-9 | 2019-6-1 -> 2019-7-1.csv`.

In the .csv report, there will be a row for each repository listed in the repoList in `config.json` with a number of metrics that will have been calculated for each of these repositories.

### Metrics

The first set of metrics is based on the entire history of the repository as of the time of the script running:

| Metric Name                                | Unit/Type     | Description                         |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-------------:| :---------------------------------- |
| Stars                                      | #             | # of stars ‚≠ê |
| Watches                                    | #             | # of watches üëÄ |
| Forks                                      | #             | # of forks üç¥ |
| Issues                                     | #             | # of issues (all time) ‚ùó |
| Issues (Internal)                          | #             | # of issues (all time) created by an internal author ‚ùó |
| Issues (External)                          | #             | # of issues (all time) created by an external author ‚ùó |
| Open Issues                                | #             | # of issues currently open ‚ùó |
| Stale Issues                               | #             | # of issues currently stale ‚ùó |
| % Stale Issues                             | %             | % of open issues that are stale ‚ùó |
| Old Issues                                 | #             | # of issues currently old ‚ùó |
| % Old Issues                               | %             | % of open issues that are old ‚ùó |


The second set is based on the specific time period provided through command line arguments:

| Metric Name                                | Unit/Type     | Description                         |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-------------:| :----------------------------------:|
| Repo Name                                  | String        | Name of the repository              |

Finally, the last row of the .csv report aggregates these same metrics for all of the repositories.
